# Energy Market Optimizer

A portfolio project to develop and showcase Python skills for **energy market modeling, optimization, and forecasting** â€” inspired by real-world roles in distributed energy systems, flexibility modeling, and market participation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains a series of incremental projects that build towards a **mini Energy Management System (EMS)** capable of:
- Forecasting electricity demand and prices
- Optimizing the operation of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as batteries and solar
- Simulating participation in day-ahead and intraday energy markets

The final goal is to integrate **optimization (LP/MILP)**, **forecasting**, and **simulation** into one polished, deployable tool.
